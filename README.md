# Four-Wheel-Drive
4WD with DC motors controlled by L2983D Motor driver implemented on Arduino Nano and consoled via HC-05 (Bluetooth 4.0). The 4WD is controlled by self made handhelddirection control console via dual-axis potentiometer also having HC-05 and Arduino Nano as MCU. As D-A pot is moved the 4WD moves. The implemented direction movements on Dual-axis pot. are:
